Smart Investment Tracker

Overview  
Smart Investment Tracker is a unified financial management app that allows users to track, compare, and invest in mutual funds (MFs) and stocks from multiple platforms—all in one place. With AI-driven insights, a user-friendly interface, and one-click execution, this app simplifies investment decisions for both beginners and experienced investors.

Key Features  
1️⃣ Automatic Portfolio Tracking

- Fetches data from _MF Central API, broker APIs_
- Displays _all investments_ with execution links (e.g., "Buy more" button for funds).
- Just like _PhonePe for bank balances_, but for stocks & mutual funds.

2️⃣ Smart AI-Powered Comparison Tool

- Uses _AI/ML_ to recommend _better performing_ funds & stocks.
- Simple visual indicators like:
  - _Trust Score_ (⭐ ratings like Uber drivers)
  - _Risk Meter_ (🟢 Low | 🟠 Medium | 🔴 High)
  - _Projected Returns_ ("₹10,000 → ₹12,000 in 1 year" 📈)
- Example: “Fund A is better than Fund B: 15% returns, same risk. Switch now? ✅”

3️⃣ One Dashboard for Tracking + Execution

- See all _MFs + stocks_ in a _single interactive dashboard_.
- One-click execution: "Invest Now" button (like Amazon’s _"Buy Now"_).
- No need to log in separately to MF Central or broker platforms.

4️⃣ Super Simple & Interactive UI

- Uses _icons & plain-English summaries_ for easy understanding.
- _One-click actions_:
  - Compare funds (like Amazon product comparison)
  - Quick Invest (like Uber’s "Book Ride")

Real-Life Example  
Imagine your father uses this app to:

1. _See all investments: _"Zerodha: ₹50K in stocks | MF Central: ₹1L in MFs."
2. _Compare Funds: AI suggests switching to a \*\*higher-return_ fund.
3. _Execute Instantly: Click _"Invest Now" to buy Fund B _without logging in elsewhere_.
